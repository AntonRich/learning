# Learning how to learn

Languages and frameworks are only part of the process - a small part. You also need to learn how to think like a developer.

1. Eliminate distractions - close browser tabs, silence your phone, use the Pomodoro method
1. Define the end goals - "What am I supposed to learn?"
1. Focus on the process - The process is much more important than the end product:
  - How do you approach a problem?
  - What do you do when you get stuck?
  - Can you brute force your way through?
1. Experiment - try new things, learn from failing, have fun
1. Reflect - ask the following questions at the end of each study session:
  - What were my objectives?
  - How far did I get?
  - How much is left?
  - How was the process?
  - Am I on the right track?

## Problem

Given the following problem, how would you break it down into manageable pieces?

  Design a web app that allows employees to submit feedback toward each other's performance review.

  Admin View:
  - CRUD employees and reviews
  - Assign employees to participate in another employee's performance review

  Employee view:
  - List of performance reviews requiring feedback
  - Feedback submission
